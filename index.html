                    I am currently studying the Engineering Pathway degree, with plans to transfer to a Bachelor of Engineering (Software). I am most interested in anything to do with computers, having built my own 3 years ago which improved my knowledge in the area, in turn only increasing my interest. I am keen further develop my knowledge on this a wide variety of other areas during my time at University, and hopefully one I have graduated and entered the workforce as well. Another thing that has piqued my curiosity, I something I definitely intend to take part in, is some form of overseas study. Whether it be a short study tour, or potentially a full semester exchange, I am very excited to travel and see the world, while also studying in my area of interest.

                    A more recent interest of mine is programming (a subset of my interest in computers), as a year ago I started to learn programming in MATLAB, which led me to seek out other languages such as Python, C++, C# and even some HTML and JavaScript. However, I did not really get the opportunity to delve very deep into any of these, and I look forward to getting to do so throughout my degree.
